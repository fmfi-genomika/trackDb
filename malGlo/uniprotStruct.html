<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows structural information about regions of specific proteins that were parsed out from UniProt database (<a href="http://www.uniprot.org/">http://www.uniprot.org/</a>). These regions were mapped to corresponding regions of the genome. MalGlo uniprot data can be found at <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000008837">http://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000008837</a>.

<h2>Structure types</h2>
This track shows only few specific structure types:
<ul>
<li>coiled-coil region</li>
<li>beta</li>
<li>helix</li>
<li>turn</li>
</ul>

Each region is annotated with its specific type in the name that is shown in the browser, for instance, position <a href="http://genomika.compbio.fmph.uniba.sk/cgi-bin/hgTracks?hgsid=323_Cl6ljmzYCQyGUo4IMAxUzCAq2Av7&db=malGlo1&position=NW_001849855.1%3A3129-3242">NW_001849855.1:3129-3242</a> displays coiled-coil region. These structure types were based on "feature type" in UniProt.
